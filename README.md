# (m,k)-firm Scheduling addition into SimSo

The idea of this project is to:
1. Simulate (m,k)-firm RMS, (m,k)-firm EDF, and (m,k)-firm EDF with DBP (Distance-based Priority) using [SimSo](https://github.com/MaximeCheramy/simso) simulation framework.
2. Once I have shown it works, submit a PR for SimSo to add it into the framework for future people to use.

# Prereq
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, I recommend using a venv, just cus.

# How to run?
1. To run (m,k)-firm RMS: `python mk_rms_runner.py`
2. To run (m,k)-firm EDF: `python mk_edf_runner.py`
3. ...todo
